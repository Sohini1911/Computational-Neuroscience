# Computational-Neuroscience
This is a project that was a part of Computational Neuroscience Course at IIT Kharagpur. 

Simulated the Morris Lecar and Hodgkin Huxley equations and performed the phase plane analysis. Extracted the important envelope features coded by each of the 4 neurons in the auditory area of the brain from the data of spike times in responses to a slowly varying stimulus, which is the envelope of a broadband noise carrier.
